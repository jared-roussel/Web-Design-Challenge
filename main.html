<h2>Project Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as one gets closer to the equator (LNG = 0). The aim was to analyze (4) common components of weather:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Maximum Temperature (Fahrenheit)</li>
    <li>Cloudiness (%)</li>
    <li>Humidity (%)</li>
    <li>Wind Speed (mph)</li>
</ul> 
<hr>
<h2>Project Methodology</h2>
<p>To accomplish the project goal, we performed the following main tasks:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Pulled data from <b>OpenWeatherMap API</b> to assemble a dataset of over 500 cities</li>
    <li>Used <b>Matplotlib</b> to plot the components of weather vs. the lattitude</li>
</ol>
